-- ============================================================================
-- DistributionOverviewPage.lua  (Distribution Redux) -- Overview tab
-- A single flat table across the WHOLE network: one row per (building, product),
-- with the building's shop image + the product's icon, then
--   Received | Loaded | Consumed | Unloaded | Held | Produced | Distributed |
--   Stored/Moved | Sold | Distr. Cost
-- Within each building the products are listed INPUTS first, then outputs -- the
-- order product actually flows through it.
-- Received / Distributed are what Distribution Redux moved; Loaded / Unloaded are
-- their manual counterparts -- product put in or taken out by anything that is not
-- DR (player trailer, bale, AI helper, another mod).
--
-- Consumed and Produced also carry the recipe's EXPECTED figure for the same window
-- in brackets: green on or above target, orange within 5% of it, red below that.
-- Only productions have a recipe, so silo / husbandry rows show a bare figure in
-- white rather than an invented target.
--
-- Four selectors sit above the table: what to Filter by (nothing / building /
-- product / end product) and which one to Show, the Timescale, and Grouping --
-- which collapses buildings of the same type into one summed row labelled
-- "Bakery x2". "End product" shows the whole supply chain feeding one product,
-- deepest ingredient first (see SmartDistribution.overviewRows' chainFt).
--
-- The product name carries what the product is to THAT building -- "(In)", "(Out)"
-- or "(In/Out)", the last being both a silo's stock and a recipe fill type that is
-- consumed and produced by the same plant.
-- A timescale selector at the top rescopes every flow column at once:
--   Hour  -> the last completed hourly distribution pass
--   Month -> the rolling 24-cycle window (what the /mo columns on the other tabs show)
--   Year  -> the rolling 12-month ring kept by DistributionStats.lua
-- HELD is deliberately NOT rescoped: it is a stock, not a flow, so it always reads
-- what the building is holding right now.
--
-- The page is a thin view: SmartDistribution.overviewRows(window) does the work
-- (engine-side, so it is identical for a multiplayer client reading the server's
-- pushed aggregates). Rows are cached and rebuilt on a ~1s throttle -- the list
-- re-renders at the base page's 2 Hz, but the enumeration behind it is the
-- expensive part and does not need to run that often.

-- Reported 2026-08-05: on a large farm the Overview takes "a good while" to appear in the SETTINGS view,
-- and stays slow with Menu refresh rate on Manual only -- because onFrameOpen rebuilds unconditionally and
-- the refresh dial only governs the PERIODIC rebuild. Speed-scrolling the whole list was reported at ~30 s.
--
-- sdStress measures SmartDistribution.overviewRows, which on a 25-building save is 40.9 ms for 210 rows --
-- nowhere near "a good while". But it does NOT cover the rest of the open: rebuildRows also builds the
-- "Show" filter list around that call, then reloadData repopulates the list, then focus is set. So the
-- measured part is only one of four, and the reported farm is ~4x the buildings AND more products each,
-- against a cost that is O(rows x placeables) -- it grows on both axes at once.
--
-- These two lines split the open into its phases and time the cell populate separately, so the next report
-- names the phase instead of us guessing at it a fifth time.
