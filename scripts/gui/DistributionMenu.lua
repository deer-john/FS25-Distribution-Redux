-- DistributionMenu.lua  (Distribution Redux)
-- The consolidated full-screen menu: a TabbedMenu with left-side tabs, one page
-- per area (Settings, Storage, Productions, Help). Mirrors the proven AutoDrive
-- ADSettings / EasyDevControls menu pattern:
--   - extends TabbedMenu
--   - onGuiSetupFinished -> setupPages(): registerPage + addPageTab + per-page
--     setMenuButtonInfo for each frame
--   - opened with g_gui:showGui("DistributionMenu"); closed with changeScreen(nil)
--
-- The page frame elements arrive as self.pageSettings / pageStorage /
-- pageProductions / pageHelp (the FrameReference ids in DistributionMenu.xml).
-- Tab icons use base-game UI slices (validated against AutoDrive/EDC usage).

    -- can have a valid market/consumer while another does not, and a single building-wide mode could not
    -- honour both. Cycling the selected output only is unambiguous.
    -- CYCLE OUTPUT IS GONE, and the in-row arrows are why: every output row carries a pair (5.64), so a

-- dispatches to g_gui.currentListener and to currentListener.target only -- it does not walk down to a
-- frame itself -- so a keyEvent override on the PAGE class is not reliably reached. This screen IS the
-- currentListener, so it always is. TabbedMenu tracks the live page as self.currentPage.
--
-- The page-level overrides are KEPT as well and cannot double-step: the superclass call below
-- propagates down the element tree first, and if a page handled the key it returns true, so this
-- returns early without acting again.
--
-- MODE_KEYS_ENABLED is how the Markets page opts out -- its MODE column is the market timing enum,
-- not the asset mode ring.
-- Is a MEANINGFUL modifier held (ctrl / alt / shift / meta), as opposed to a lock bit?
--
-- MEASURED, and it is why the first two attempts at this key did nothing: the guard was
-- `modifier == 0`, but a menu key press arrives with **modifier = 4096** permanently set -- a lock
-- bit (Num Lock), not a held key. `x` arrives with the same 4096 and only works because its input
-- action never looks at modifiers. So the test has to be on the bits that MATTER, not on the whole
-- value being zero.
--
-- The mask is assembled from whichever constants this build actually defines: only MOD_LCTRL and
-- MOD_LMETA appear anywhere in the shipped source, so the rest are plausible but unconfirmed names
-- (8.1) and a nil must not break the test. If none resolve, the mask is 0 and this reports "no
-- modifier", which fails toward the key WORKING rather than being silently dead again.

---A SECOND ICON IN THE CORNER OF ONE TAB.
--
-- WHY THIS OVERRIDE EXISTS AT ALL. A tab carries ONE icon slice
-- (TabbedMenu:addPageTab's fourth argument), and the base game's icons live as
-- SLICES inside dataS.gar -- so two of them cannot be merged into a file, and the
-- only way to show both is to draw both. This is the place that can.
--
-- IT IS PRECISELY SCOPED BY CONSTRUCTION, not by a guard. SmoothListElement takes
-- its data source from #listDataSource, defaulting to the element's TARGET; the
-- tab list in DistributionMenu.xml declares none, so its data source is this MENU
-- and this method serves the TAB LIST AND NOTHING ELSE. Every other list in the
-- mod sits inside a page and is populated by that page. So this is not the global
-- class hook 5.62 warns about -- no other menu in the game is touched.
--
-- WRITTEN AS A POST-STEP. The inherited populate runs FIRST and unchanged, so a
-- tab with no badge is byte-identical to before and a failure here can only cost
-- the badge, never the icon or the tab.
--
-- THE BASE IMPLEMENTATION IS STRIPPED FROM THE SDK SOURCE (8.1) -- there is not
-- one surviving populateCellForItemInSection anywhere in it, so the cell's own
-- structure could not be read. That is why the badge element is declared in the
-- ListItem template in OUR XML and only LOOKED UP here: creating an element blind
-- would be guessing at a profile and an anchor, while looking one up by name
-- either finds it or does nothing.
